verify. py uses twilio services to send an otp to your phone number and it also verifies whether the entered otp is correct or not.
the templates folder has all css, html and js script.
connector.py sends the new user data and filters the existing users, if their phone numbers are already in the data base.
we used mongo db for the data base
we induced the same functionality in verify. py as well for easy access.
